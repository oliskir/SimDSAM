# SimDSAM

Monte Carlo simulation program for modeling of gamma-ray line shapes obtained in Doppler-shift attenuation-method (DSAM) experiments. Used for the analysis of the experiment S1378, performed at TRIUMF in October 2012. The results have been published in [O. S. Kirsebom et al., Phys. Rev. C 93, 025802 (2016)](https://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.93.025802).

This was my first major coding project in C++. Luckily, my grasp of object-oriented programming has improved considerably since. For a more recent project, see for example [DCAP](https://gitlab.au.dk/ausa/oliskir/dcap).
